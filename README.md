Blurplefier Standalone
=========

A (WIP) standalone version of the blurplefier part of the Blurplefier bot (from Project Blurple), in order to more easily convert an image to its blurple variant. Once it's ready, it'll be as simple as importing the blurplefier file in Python and running the conversion function.

> Why?

Because I like the Burplefier bot and think its conversion tool is really neat. I believe it'll be of great help with [my Blurplefied Resource Pack for Minecraft](https://github.com/Sonic4999/Blurplefied-Resource-Pack), as I've previously had to use this really obscure program that has been removed from GitHub.

> Why not make your own solution from scratch, then?

Because I don't want to re-invent the wheel. Simple as that.

> Isn't this stealing their code?

Guess you could say it is, but I'm not trying to say this is my own work. Just a modification of theirs. Plus, it's under the MIT license, I can technically do this just fine.
